# MLG Soundboard using Web Audio API

## Description
This features a simple soundboard using Web Sound API and distortion effects. 
You can find the distortion effects on https://github.com/web-audio-components/overdrive.


## Installation

You don't need to install anything. Just visit [soundboard.panictank.net](http://soundboard.panictank.net). 
If you want to create your own soundboard pull this git repository. Change the sound & sourcefiles in board.js, add an own loading.gif
and host your own soundboard. 

## Usage

* Open your browser
* Go to [soundboard.panictank.net](http://soundboard.panictank.net)

It's tested on Firefox 32.0 (current version) and Chrome 34 (current) and will work likely for future version.
Other browsers don't seem to work because they haven't implemented the Web Audio API, yet.
